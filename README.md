# [X] String Manipulation
Create a form that only accepts letters and manipulate the string.

## Requirements

- [X] The text input should only accept letters and no numbers.
	- [accept letters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-pattern).

- [X] Implement the logic in the `reversal` function that reverses the order of the characters in the string, and outputs the result in the DOM, below the text input.

- [X] Implement the logic in the `alphabits` function that return the characters in alphabetical order, and outputs the result in the DOM, below the text input.

- [X] Implement the logic in the `palindrome` function that determine whether the string is a palindrome. If it is, display the text "Your string is a palidrome" in the DOM, below the text input.

- [X] When the user presses the enter key in the text input, or clicks the button, set the value of the `testString` variable (see below) to the value of the input.

- [X] The output of each of the functions should immediately appear as well.
